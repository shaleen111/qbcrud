# QBCRUD

## Introduction
QBCRUD was an application I wrote for a project at school. Aiming to create a basic CRUD application with proper UI in QBASIC, and that too in a DOS Shell, this project quickly grew out of hand into a 1500 line behemoth. Its still quite basic, most of the project deals with UI more than CRUD actions. It has some basic error handling however I don't thing there is a single comment anywhere.

## Installation

Installation is quite easy: install DOSBox and then download QB 4.5 (or just use this: [QB + DOS installer](https://bit.ly/2UA57vP)). Run QB 4.5 from within DOSBox and open the PROJ.BAS file from within the QB interpreter.
Note: The .BAS file needs to be placed in the same directory as QB.EXE
