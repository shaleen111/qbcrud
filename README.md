A simple (but polished) implementation of the Snake game in Rust.
Made with the intention of getting used to Rust as well as the graphics libraries available for it.

## Tested On

- [x]  Windows (on DOSBox 0.74)
- [ ]  macOS
- [ ]  Linux

## Installation

Installation is quite easy:
1. Install DOSBox and then download QB 4.5 (or just use this: [QB + DOS installer](https://bit.ly/2UA57vP)).
2. Run QB 4.5 from within DOSBox and open the PROJ.BAS file from within the QB interpreter.


Note: The .BAS file needs to be placed in the same directory as QB.EXE

## Roadmap

None! This project is as complete as it will ever be!
